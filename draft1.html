<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Abstract</h3>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been one of the most debated issues in the field of engineering.
Robots are also subject to these debates because that tangible spin-off technology that will be run
by such an AI that will have superior cognitive and perceptive abilities than that of humankind.
Many researchers argue that the creation of AI will deeply elevate society and it will help
humankind to solve major societal problems, while others refute the arguments for that conceptual
invention. This paper explores these issues that the creation of AI will raise, and it
attributes these problems to widely varying definitions and the applications of these
technologies.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Even though the term robot was coined two centuries ago and preliminary contemplation of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged decades ago, some of the problems that have been raised by
these two terms are yet to be solved. Sometimes, solutions for any arbitrary problem can be
addressed by seeing the bigger picture rather than scrutinizing tiny details. Thus, this paper
explores problems related to legal, ethical frameworks and then analyzes the numerous definitions
and applications of these technologies which pose challenges on varying levels, from individual to
societal. The formation of this paper is as follows: The second and third sections then
scrutinize the definitions and the applications of robots, respectively, to attribute the
reasons for these issues, and the third section categorizes the issues that robotics have
arisen.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>What is a Robot?</h3>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >By literary definition the term robot is derived from the Czech word "roboti" meaning serf-labor.
However, this definition closely referring to slave-like laborer has become something brand new as
technology advances. In his article entitled "The Sheer Difficulty of Defining What a Robot Is",
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> discusses two distinctive definitions of robotics that are posed by the prominent
experts in the field of robotics. These two definitions emphasize different aspects of robotics
creating important distinctions among them. The first definition puts emphasis on the
successful combination of a rigid body responsible for interacting with its environment and a

central reasoning unit responsible for reasoning tasks based perception and cognition.
Without a software and hardware collaboration, as <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> cites in his article,
accomplishing its tasks for a robot cannot be possible. The second definition, however, takes
autonomy into account. A robot, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> quotes in his article, must have an detailed
idea of any action formed by a tedious plan, accurate reasoning and precise action to
interact with its physical environment, which closely aligns with the definition provided by
<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xlin">Lin, Abney,&#x00A0;&amp; Bekey</a>, 2011)</span>. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a></span> <span class="cite">(2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> define a robot as "an engineered
machine that senses, thinks, and acts". In other words, roboticists have not been able to
reach a consensus on the definition of robots the embodiment of AI, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span>
note.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>What (should) does a Robot do?</h3>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >In order to make its obfuscated definition clear, the tasks of AI should be addressed. On the one
hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> note that robots are employed in such tasks called "three D&#8217;s"
referring "dull, dirty, or dangerous" tasks. From that instruction, a robot should replace human
where the task contains either mundane chores, or risks of contamination, or threatening factors for
human lives.
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >On the other hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> and <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span> list many different real life robotic
applications, from laborer robots to medical purpose robots and to personal care and companion
robots, which contradicts with given instruction. While <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> also excludes any means of
social interaction in the definitions of robotics proposed in this article, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrodhan">Al-Rodhan</a> (2015)</span>
elaborates this issue by indicating an emerging application of robotics, a molecular level robot
which identifies cancerous cells and attack them by releasing antibodies, thereby eliminating
cancerous cells. Even though experts have not been able to solve dilemmas within the field of
robotics, this continuum of sophistication within robotics add more complex issues to the
pile.

<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>The Most Profound Issues of Robotics</h3>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >From its very early contemplations of AI, it has been the most controversial issue within the
engineering and scientific societies due to its ethical problems. Near future is fecund to many
dilemmas which humankind, soon or later, will face regarding AI&#8217;s moral integrity and its position
in society. This section synthesizes the issues of employment of AI and robots in a wide spectrum
of tasks.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Safety Issues</h4>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Akin to the nature of any given invention, the ultimate reason for the invention of robots is the
elevation of life conditions and inquiry about applicable solutions for societal problems. However, a
major issue having been discussed is whether or not the military, one of the biggest supporter of
robotics, is being sincere with its funding purposes <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski, Lisin,&#x00A0;&amp; Oks</a>, n.d.)</span>.
Of the many supporters of such research studies, the military appears to be the most
questionable one due to plausible intentions of creation of humanoid army. This utilization of a
weaponized robotic army would boost the vast possession of ammunition problem instead of
mediating inter-governmental conflicts. This contentious utilization of battlefield robots
is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to mediate inter-governmental conflicts.
Such probability may put countries in circumstances resembling strongly to the Cold
War.
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Legal and Ethical Issues</h4>
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Furthering concerns about their military applications, robots are envisioned to be controlled by a

such intelligence which enable their to perceive their surrounding environments where they interact
with the objects by themselves. Thus, robots can be regarded as independent agents. This
conceptual freedom, however, raises an ethical dilemma caused by the absence of legal
ramifications of AI. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> examine that ambiguity by posing a controversial
question: "Who will be responsible for results of AI&#8217;s actions and failure?" Since the contemplation
of AI and robots indicates that robots will supposedly make their own choices to take actions
according to these choices, another interesting question arises: "Would robots be prosecuted
-maybe executed- because of the fails they commit?" Similar to the questions above, there are
many questions that governments need to address by creating regulations and laws under which
robots will be positioned.
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, many researchers have been questioning whether or not these super-intelligent agents
should have duties, such as taxing, to society; if so, to what extent governments should give social
rights to robots. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbob">Roberts</a> (n.d.)</span> addresses this issue by underlining basic rights and duties of
citizens such as taxing and voting. In other words, not only does AI&#8217;s legal ramification matter,
but it is also equally important for governments to decide the AI&#8217;s responsibility for
the society, vice versa. To address this issue, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xkerb">Kerb</a> (2006)</span> analyzes Japanese artworks
showing futuristic plots based upon robots cohabitating and interacting with humans.
These artworks depicts the very early speculations of social equality between man and
machine regarding civil and political rights among. Kerb&#8217;s evaluation of these artworks
concludes that robots, depicted and envisioned in the artworks, are neither overlords nor
serf-laborers.
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Psychological Challenges and Socio-economic Issues</h4>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >Social interaction is what differentiates humans from machines. However, as the research studies
toward creation of AI have gone deeper, robots have become more socially interactive within
society. In light of definitions given in the first section, robots have to interact with their physical

environment. However, such definitions exclude any means of social interactions, even though
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> asserts that socially interactive robots are significantly popular in society.
This discrepancy brings about a major problem on the individual and societal levels.
One example of this fact is that individuals have started to get strong advice from AI
applications, a software crunching numbers faster than a man can do, rather than a close friend
who might know better about the individual seeking advice, such as the taste in music
or book. Even though this issue seems to have a minor flipside, once it is aggregated
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> claims, it will create true alienation from society and confusion regarding
personhood.
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >Another matter that deeply affects human psychology is that innovative superiority of robots
seems to increase profitability and efficiency in workplaces, albeit undermining the true value of
failures. Given that failures are one of most essential component of human learning process,
superiority of AI tend to discourage individuals to commit any form of actions due
to fear of failures. This fear impedes the same body of individuals to learn, hindering
them completely to trust human judgment . Depression and other similar psychological
challenges are the most profound indicators of the aftermaths of inaccurate definition of
AI.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the rise of computers has led to lessen the human employment starting from late
70&#8217;s. Because of the downsizing tendency of corporations which resulted from this replacement,
millions of low-skilled workers lost their jobs. Robots and AI supposedly represent the
maxima of accuracy and repeatability, which promotes reliance on AI thanks to their
cognitive and learning abilities that outperform human abilities. Given that historic fact,
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> predict that this reliance might cause an inevitable replacement
of low-skilled laborers with the more powerful robots, akin to the aftermaths of the
computerization era. In light of that prediction, highly developed economies may show a
strong recession due to the significant loss in human work power and if this aggressive
expansion continues, other occupations and professions will be under the same risk of

mechanization.
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >Along with the economical effects of workplace computerization, eradication of low-skilled jobs
may lead to the expansion of the gap among the social groups <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a>, n.d.)</span>. For instance,
as the first paragraph of this section indicates, those who can use computers or know how to
develop software have reached to higher classes in societies, while others could not seize the same
momentum. This computerization instructs young individual belong to lower layers of
society to believe that there is no way to elevate in society. This expansion in the gap
with in society and among the social groups clearly contradicts to the societal goals of
robotics.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >The notion of increasingly accelerating technology with the precious help of scientific
research studies thrills individuals. Yet, it is crucially important to decide whether or not
robots are simply functional machines that are utilitarian in their responsibilities and
nothing more. If so, it is irrelevant to discuss the ethical problems arisen by its creation
because the problems will become a question of accuracy of the source code that runs
robots and forms AI. In that case, the matter should be discussed would be how to
mitigate, even eradicate, human errors taking place when roboticists develop robots and
AI.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >As for the ethical problems, robots will highly likely to be no more prone to erroneousness than
any other human invention. If evolutionary and development psychology is taken into account, the
first members of fully autonomous social robots will also evolve rapidly to their excellence. As the
expansion and the accessibility to AI and robotics increase, the prediction of the aftermath has
become obsolete due to the late response of individuals and their wisdom toward these
technologies. Thus, robotics and AI should be scrutinized to understand and formulate its
definitions and functions, otherwise yet another issue will jump into debate topics before formers

could be solved.
