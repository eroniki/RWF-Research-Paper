 id="x1-1000"></a>Abstract</h3>
Of all the tools and methods invented by humankind to tame nature and make use of its
challenges, the invention of computer has had the greatest impact on society. Coupled with the
Internet, computers have changed the way billions of humans work, entertain themselves,
and think. Since the rise of the computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been one of
the most debated issues in the field of engineering. Robots are also subject to these
debates because that tangible spin-off technology that will be run by such an AI that will
have superior cognitive and perceptive abilities than that of man. Many researchers
argue that the creation of AI will deeply elevate society and it will help humankind to
solve major societal problems, while others refute the arguments for that conceptual
invention. This paper explores these issues that the creation of AI will raise, and it
attributes these problems to widely varying definitions and the applications of these
technologies.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Even though the term robot was coined two centuries ago and preliminary contemplation of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged decades ago, some of the problems that have been
raised by these two terms are yet to be solved. Sometimes, solutions for any arbitrary
problem can be addressed by seeing the bigger picture rather than scrutinizing tiny details.
Thus, this paper explores these problems and then analyzes the numerous definitions
and applications of these technologies which pose challenges on varying levels, from
individual to societal. The formation of this paper is as follows: The first section categorizes
the issues that robotics have arisen; the second and third sections then scrutinize the
definitions and the applications of robots, respectively, to attribute the reasons of these
issues.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>The Most Profound Issues of Robotics</h3>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >From the very early contemplations of AI, it has been the most controversial issue within the
engineering and scientific societies due to its ethical problems. Near future is fecund to many
dilemmas which humankind, soon or later, will face regarding AI&#8217;s moral integrity and its position
in society. This section synthesizes the issues of employment of AI and robots in a wide spectrum
of tasks.
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Safety Issues</h4>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >Akin to the nature of any given invention, the ultimate reason for the invention of robots is the
elevation of life conditions and inquiry about applicable solutions for societal problems.
However, a major issue having been discussed is whether or not military, one of the biggest
supporter of robotics, is being sincere with its funding purposes <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski, Lisin,&#x00A0;&amp; Oks</a>,
n.d.)</span>. Of the many supporters of such research studies, military appears to be the most
questionable one due to plausible intentions of creation of humanoid army. This utilization of a
weaponized robotic army would boost the vast possession of ammunition problem instead of
mediating inter-governmental conflicts. This contentious utilization of battlefield robots
is one of the biggest concern when it comes to mediate inter-governmental conflicts.
Such probability may put countries in circumstances resembling strongly to the Cold
War.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Legal and Ethical Issues</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Robots are envisioned to be controlled by a such intelligence which enable their to perceive their
surrounding environments where they interact with the objects by themselves. Thus, they can be
regarded as independent agents. This conceptual freedom, however, raises an ethical dilemma
caused by the absence of legal ramifications of AI. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> examine that
ambiguity by posing a controversial question: "Who will be responsible for results of AI&#8217;s
actions and failure?" Since the contemplation of AI and robots indicates that robots will
supposedly make their own choices take actions according to these choices, another
interesting question arises: "Would robots be prosecuted -maybe executed- because of
the fails they commit?" Similar to the questions above, there are many questions that
governments need to address by creating regulations and laws under which robots will be
positioned.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, many researchers has been questioning whether or not these super-intelligent agents

should have duties to society; if so, to what extent governments should give social rights to robots.
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbob">Roberts</a> (n.d.)</span> addresses this issue by underlining basic rights and duties of citizens
such as taxing and voting. In other words, not only does AI&#8217;s legal ramification matter,
but it is also equally important for governments to decide the AI&#8217;s responsibility for
the society, vice versa. To address this issue, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xkerb">Kerb</a> (2006)</span> analyzes Japanese artworks
showing futuristic plots based upon robots cohabitating and interacting with humans.
These artworks depicts the very early speculations of social equality between man and
machine regarding civil and political rights among. Kerb&#8217;s evaluation of these artworks
concludes that robots, depicted and envisioned in the artworks, are neither overlords nor
serf-laborers.
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Psychological Challenges and Socio-economic Issues</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Social interaction is what differentiates humans from machines. However, as the research studies
toward creation of AI have gone deeper, robots have become more socially interactive within
society. For instance, before GPS became publicly available, route planning was based upon
map-reading and asking directions of the locals. In light of this example, AI has become route
planning assistant and has decreased the interrelation among individuals. According to <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a>
(2010)</span>, reformation of our perception towards AI poses misconceptions regarding personhood and
promotes loneliness. This issue truly matters due to the fact that alienation from the society relies
on that misconception. Another matter that deeply affects human psychology is that innovative
superiority of robots seems to increase profitability and efficiency, albeit undermining the true
value of failures. Given that failures are one of most essential component of human learning
process, superiority of AI discourage individuals to commit any form of actions due
to fear of failures. This fear impedes the same body of individuals to learn and trust
human judgment, hindering them completely. Depression and other similar psychological
challenges are the most profound indicators of the aftermaths of inaccurate definition of

AI.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the rise of computers has led to lessen the human employment starting from
late 70&#8217;s. Because of the downsizing tendency of corporations which resulted from this
replacement, millions of low-skilled workers lost their jobs. Robots and AI supposedly
represent the maxima of accuracy and repeatability which promotes reliance on AI thanks
to their cognitive and learning abilities that outperform human abilities. Given that
historic fact, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> predict that this reliance might cause an inevitable
replacement of low-skilled laborers with the more powerful robots, akin to aftermaths of the
computerization era. In light of that prediction, highly developed economies may show a
strong recession due to the significant lost in human work power and if this aggressive
expansion continues, other occupations and professions will be under the same risk of
mechanization.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Along with the economical effects of workplace computerization, eradication of low-skilled jobs
may lead the expansion of the gap among the social groups <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a>, n.d.)</span>. For instance,
as the first paragraph of this section indicates, those who can use computers or know developing
software have reached to higher classes in societies, while other could not seize the same
momentum. This computerization instruct young individual belong to lower layers of
society to believe that there is no way to elevate in society. This expansion in the gap
with in society and among the social groups clearly contradicts to the societal goals of
robotics.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>What is a Robot?</h4>

<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >By literary definition the term robot is derived from the Czech word "roboti" meaning serf-labor.
However, this definition closely referring to slave-like laborer has become something brand new as
technology advances. In his article entitled "The Sheer Difficulty of Defining What a Robot Is",
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> discusses two distinctive definitions of robotics that are posed by the prominent
experts in the field of robotics. These two definitions emphasize different aspects of robotics
creating important distinctions among them. The first definition puts emphasis on the successful
combination of a rigid body responsible for interacting with its environment and a central
reasoning unit responsible for reasoning tasks based perception and cognition. Without a software
and hardware collaboration, as <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> cites in his article, accomplishing its tasks
for a robot cannot be possible. The second definition, however, takes autonomy into
account. A robot, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> quotes in his article, must have an detailed idea of
any action formed by a tedious plan, accurate reasoning and precise action to interact
with its physical environment which closely aligns with the definition provided by <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xlin">Lin,
Abney,&#x00A0;&amp; Bekey</a>, 2011)</span>. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a></span> <span class="cite">(2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> define a robot as "an engineered machine
that senses, thinks, and acts". In light of these definitions, robots have to interact with
its environment. However, such definitions exclude any means of social interactions.
However, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> asserts that socially interaction robots are significantly popular in
society. This discrepancy brings about a major problem on the individual and societal
levels. One example of this fact is that individuals have started to get strong advice
from AI applications, a software crunching numbers faster than a man can do, rather
than a close friend who might know better about the individual seeking advice, such
as the taste in music or book. Even though this issue seems to have a minor flipside,
once it is aggregated <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> claims, it will create true alienation from society
and confusion regarding personhood. In other words, roboticists have not been able to
reach a consensus on the definition of robots the embodiment of AI, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span>
note.

<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>What (should) does a Robot do?</h4>
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >In order to make its obfuscated definition clear, the tasks of AI should be addressed. On the one
hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> note that robots are employed in such tasks called "three D&#8217;s"
referring "dull, dirty, or dangerous" tasks. From that instruction, a robot should replace human
where the task contains either mundane chores, or risks of contamination, or threatening factors for
human lives.
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >On the other hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> and <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span> list many different real life robotic
applications, from laborer robots to medical purpose robots and to personal care and companion
robots, which contradicts with given instruction. While <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> also excludes any means of
social interaction in the definitions of robotics proposed in this article, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrodhan">Al-Rodhan</a> (2015)</span>
elaborates this issue by indicating an emerging application of robotics, a molecular level robot
which identifies cancerous cells and attack them by releasing antibodies, thereby eliminating
cancerous cells. Even though experts have not been able to solve dilemmas within the field of
robotics, this continuum of sophistication within robotics add more complex issues to the
pile.
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >The notion of increasingly accelerating technology with the precious help of scientific research
studies thrills individuals, and gives hope to patients. Yet, it is crucially important to decide
whether or not robots are simply functional machines that are utilitarian in their responsibilities
and nothing more. If so, it is irrelevant to discuss the ethical problems arisen by its creation
because the problems will become a question of accuracy of the source code that runs
robots and forms AI. In that case, the matter should be discussed would be how to
mitigate, even eradicate, human errors taking place when roboticists develop robots and
AI.

<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >As for the ethical problems, they will highly likely to be no more prone to erroneousness than any
other human invention. If evolutionary and development psychology is taken into account, the first
members of fully autonomous social robots will also evolve rapidly to their excellence. As the
expansion and the accessibility to AI and robotics increase, the prediction of the aftermath has
become decrepit due to the late response of individuals and their wisdom toward these
technologies. Thus, robotics and AI should be scrutinized to understand and formulate its
definitions and functions, otherwise yet another issue will jump into debate topics before formers
could be solved.
