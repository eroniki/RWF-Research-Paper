<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Abstract</h3>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been one of the most debated issues in the field of engineering.
Robots are also subject to these debates because that tangible spin-off technology that will be run
by such an AI that will have superior cognitive and perceptive abilities than that of humankind.
Many researchers argue that the creation of AI will deeply elevate society and it will help
humankind to solve major societal problems, while others refute the arguments for that conceptual
invention. This paper explores these issues that the creation of AI will raise, and it
attributes these problems to widely varying definitions and the applications of these
technologies.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Even though the term robot was coined two centuries ago and preliminary contemplation of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged decades ago, some of the problems that have been raised by
these two terms are yet to be solved. Sometimes, solutions for any arbitrary problem can be
addressed by seeing the bigger picture rather than scrutinizing tiny details. Thus, this paper
explores problems related to legal, ethical frameworks and then analyzes the numerous definitions
and applications of these technologies which pose challenges on varying levels, from individual to
societal. The formation of this paper is as follows: The first and second sections scrutinize
the definitions and the applications of robots, respectively, to attribute the reasons for
these issues, and the third section then categorizes the issues that robotics have brought
about.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>What is a Robot?</h3>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >By literary definition the term robot is derived from the Czech word "roboti" meaning serf-laborer.
However, this definition closely referring to a slave-like laborer has become something brand new as
technology advances. In his article entitled "The Sheer Difficulty of Defining What a Robot Is",
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> discusses two distinctive definitions of robotics that are posed by the
prominent experts in the field of robotics. These two definitions emphasize different
aspects of robotics creating important distinctions among them. The first definition puts
emphasis on the successful combination of a rigid body responsible for interacting with its

environment and a central processing unit responsible for reasoning tasks based on perception
and cognition. A robot cannot accomplish its tasks without a software and hardware
collaboration, as <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> cites in his article. The second definition, however, takes
autonomy into account. A robot, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> quotes in his article, must have a detailed
idea of any action formed by a rigorous plan, accurate reasoning and precise action to
interact with its physical environment, which closely aligns with the definition provided by
<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xlin">Lin, Abney,&#x00A0;&amp; Bekey</a>, 2011)</span>. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a></span> <span class="cite">(2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> define a robot as "an engineered
machine that senses, thinks, and acts". In other words, roboticists have not been able to
reach a consensus on the definition of robots, the embodiment of AI, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span>
note.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>What (should / does) a Robot do?</h3>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >In order to make its obfuscated definition clear, the tasks of AI should be addressed. On the one
hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011, p.&#x00A0;943)</span> note that robots are employed in tasks called "three D&#8217;s" referring
to "dull, dirty, or dangerous" tasks. From that instruction, a robot should replace a human where
the task contains either mundane chores, or risks of contamination, or threats to human
lives.
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >On the other hand, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> and <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span> list many different real-life robotic
applications, from laborer robots to medical-purpose robots and to personal care and companion
robots, which contradicts the "Three D&#8217;s". While <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpear">Pearson</a> (2015)</span> also excludes any means of social
interaction in the definitions of robotics proposed in this article, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrodhan">Al-Rodhan</a> (2015)</span> elaborates on
this issue by indicating an emerging application of robotics, a molecular level robot which identifies
cancerous cells and attacks them by releasing antibodies, thereby eliminating cancerous
cells. Even though experts have not been able to solve dilemmas within the field of
robotics, this continuum of sophistication within robotics adds more complex issues to the
pile.

<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>The Most Profound Issues of Robotics</h3>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >From its very early contemplations, AI has been the most controversial issue within the engineering
and scientific societies due to its ethical problems. The near future is fecund with many dilemmas
which humankind, sooner or later, will face regarding AI&#8217;s moral integrity and its position in
society. This section synthesizes the issues of employment of AI and robots in a wide spectrum of
tasks.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Safety Issues</h4>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Akin to the nature of any given invention, the ultimate reason for the invention of robots is the
elevation of life conditions and inquiry about applicable solutions for societal problems. However, a
major issue being discussed is whether or not the military, one of the biggest supporters of
robotics, is being sincere with its funding purposes <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski, Lisin,&#x00A0;&amp; Oks</a>, n.d.)</span>.
Of the many supporters of such research studies, the military appears to be the most
questionable one due to plausible intentions of creation of a humanoid army. This utilization
of a weaponized robotic army would boost the vast possession of ammunition instead
of mediating inter-governmental conflicts. This contentious utilization of battlefield
robots is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to resolving inter-governmental
conflicts. Such probability may put countries in circumstances strongly resembling the Cold
War.
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Coupled with the military concerns, human source code errors are yet another issue impeding
roboticists from developing the software. As computer scientists, fallible human beings, compile
millions of lines of code into one "perfect" software, the risk of robot failure due to errors in the
code is soaring. A tiny flaw on the software level, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a> (2011)</span> note, can lead to fatal

results.
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, hacking has been the most debated issue since the Internet became publicly available.
Along with many other safety issues, hacking is an associated issue regarding when it comes to
securely integrating robots in work settings. In this case, the risk is not identity theft or
any other illegal activity. If a hacker can grant access in a cryptic way to the robots&#8217;
central processing unit, s/he can make the robot commit any action s/he wants. So, all of
the superior abilities, namely, "its strength, ability to access and operate in difficult
environments, expendability and so on", may be turned against society <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a>,
2011, p.&#x00A0;945)</span>. This possibility clearly contradicts the ultimate goal of the creation of
robots.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Legal and Ethical Issues</h4>
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >Furthering concerns about their military applications, robots are envisioned to be controlled by an
intelligence which will enable them to perceive their surrounding environments where they can
interact with objects by themselves. Thus, robots can be regarded as independent agents. This
conceptual freedom, however, raises an ethical dilemma caused by the absence of legal
ramifications for AI. The first fatal accident that resulted in a killing of a laborer by a robot is
believed to have taken place in the late 70&#8217;s <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xlin">Lin&#x00A0;et al.</a>, 2011)</span>. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> examine that
ambiguity by posing a controversial question: "Who will be responsible for the results of AI&#8217;s
actions and failures?" Since the contemplation of AI and robots replacing laborers in some tasks
indicates that robots will supposedly make their own choices to take actions according to these
choices, another interesting question arises: "Would robots be prosecuted -maybe executed-
because of their failures?" Similar to the questions above, there are many questions that
governments need to address by creating regulations and laws with which robots will
comply.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, many researchers have been questioning whether or not these super-intelligent agents

should have duties to society, such as paying taxes; if so, to what extent should governments give
social rights to robots? <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbob">Roberts</a> (n.d.)</span> addresses this issue by underlining basic rights and duties of
citizens such as paying taxes and voting. In other words, not only does AI&#8217;s legal ramification
matter, but it is also equally important for governments to decide the AI&#8217;s responsibility to society,
and vice versa. To address this issue, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xkerb">Kerb</a> (2006)</span> analyzes Japanese artwork showing futuristic
plots based upon robots cohabitating and interacting with humans. This artwork depicts the very
early speculations of social equality between man and machine regarding civil and political
rights.
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Psychological Challenges and Socio-economic Issues</h4>
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >Social interaction is what differentiates humans from machines. However, as the research studies
toward creation of AI have gone deeper, robots have become more socially interactive with society.
In light of definitions given in the first section, robots have to interact with their physical
environment. However, such definitions exclude any means of human interactions, even though
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> asserts that socially interactive robots are significantly popular in society. This
discrepancy brings about a major problem on the individual and societal levels. One example of
this fact is that individuals have started to get strong advice from AI applications, a
software crunching numbers faster than a man can do, rather than a close friend who
might know better about the individual seeking advice, such as his/her taste in music or
books. Even though this issue seems to have a minor flip-side, once it is aggregated
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlan">Lanier</a> (2010)</span> claims, it will create true alienation from society and confusion regarding
personhood.
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >Another matter that deeply affects human psychology is that innovative superiority of robots
seems to increase profitability and efficiency in the workplaces, thereby undermining the true value
of failures. Given that failures are one of most essential component of the human learning process,
the superiority of AI tends to discourage individuals from committing any form of actions due to

the fear of failure. This fear impedes the same body of individuals to learn, hindering
them completely to trust human judgment . Depression and other similar psychological
challenges are the most profound indicators of the aftermath of an inaccurate definition of
AI.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the rise of computers has led to the lessening the human employment starting from
the late 70&#8217;s. Because of the downsizing tendency of corporations which has resulted from this
replacement, millions of low-skilled workers have lost their jobs. Robots and AI supposedly
represent the maxima of accuracy and repeatability, which promotes reliance on AI thanks
to their cognitive and learning abilities that outperform human abilities. Given that
historic fact, <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a> (n.d.)</span> predict that this reliance might cause an inevitable
replacement of low-skilled laborers with the more powerful robots, akin to the aftermath of the
computerization era. In light of that prediction, highly developed economies may show a
strong recession due to the significant loss in human work power and if this aggressive
expansion continues, other occupations and professions will be under the same risk of
mechanization.
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >Along with the economic effects of workplace computerization, eradication of low-skilled jobs may
lead to the expansion of the gap among the social groups <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xgre">Grebelski&#x00A0;et al.</a>, n.d.)</span>. For instance, as
the first paragraph of this section indicates, those who can use computers or know how to develop
software have reached the higher classes in societies, while others could not seize the same
momentum. This computerization instructs young individuals belonging to the lower layers of
society to believe that there is no way to elevate in society. This expansion in the gap
within society and among the social groups clearly contradicts the societal goals of
robotics.
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >The notion of increasingly accelerating technology with the valuable help of scientific research

studies thrills individuals.
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Yet, it is crucially important to decide whether or not robots are simply functional machines that
are utilitarian in their responsibilities and nothing more. If so, it is irrelevant to discuss the ethical
problems that have arisen by its creation because the problems will become a question of accuracy
of the source code that runs robots and. In that case, the matter should be discussed would be how
to mitigate, even eradicate, human errors taking place when roboticists develop robots and
AI.
<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >As for the ethical problems, there are two distinctive approaches to the future of robots. The first
one is that robots will highly likely be no more prone to errors than any other human invention. If
evolutionary psychology is taken into account, the first fully autonomous robots will also evolve
rapidly toward their excellence. Moreover, the second approach claims that as the expansion and
the accessibility to AI and robotics increase, the prediction of the aftermath has become obsolete
due to the late response of individuals and their wisdom toward these technologies. Thus, robotics
should be thoroughly scrutinized by various roboticists, scientists, ethicists, psychologists,
sociologists and many other experts to understand and formulate its limitations and
endless possibilities, otherwise yet another issue will develop into controversy before
former ones can be solved like in the case of Genetically Modified Organisms and the
Internet.
